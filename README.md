# Goals

We will develop the website for our UI framework and at least 5 UI elements.

Use the visual designs provided by MD as references while developing UI elements and the website.

# Rules

- Don’t copy any code from anywhere. Build your UI elements from scratch.
- Don’t use JavaScript unless you decide you absolutely need it.
- All UI elements must be responsive, but you can work on full responsiveness after the hackathon.
- You don’t have to complete the website during the hackathon. Try to build as many UI elements as possible first; if you have time to build the website or if you feel confident you can complete twenty elements and the website, do both.
- You must submit your project (a link to the GitHub repo and a link to a live webpage with the elements) before 9 p.m. EST on the last day of the hackathon.
- Don’t use jQuery or any other library. You don’t want to download a big library just to use a tooltip.
- Each team must submit at least two innovative elements; see the details below.
- Remember that each teammate must submit a writeup no later than 12 hours after you submit your project.
