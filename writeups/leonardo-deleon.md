# Leonardo Deleonâ€™s Writeup

> A summary of my experiences with Team 12 of the MD Hackathon on Feb 24-26 2017.

Hi all, here's my complete experience working with Feb hackathon team 12 and I sort of done a short check up write up while working through the assignment in a narrative style (I am writing the write up as I worked on my developing - Why?? I figured this will help me get through the long night, burning the midnight oil).

As I have learned from the CSS chapter, every good UI design must first have a good, solid base to start with and that comes in the form of a good html markup. So that is what I did. I wrote a rough write up of the html mark up for the tab project.

A little while later, I started incorporating the styling, but before I go further I would like to expressed with many thanks to our team leader [@cbracco](http://github.com/cbracco), who literally jumped started and provided for all the team not just the website layout, but set up the slack channels and the Trello boards, the GitHub repo and made sure we are all configured to push and pull. He literally set everything up for the team including a filing system that is well organise and easy to follow. I don't know what this eat for breakfast but he is a true champ. This guy is really like superman.

Ok back to styling, I realise that this hackathon is not just about making your element look good and functional, it's also about adhering to CSS best practices and framework design. This could be a stumbling block for me. It's a good thing we have @kubbafox on board. He's the product manager and will make sure our codes are up to par.

At this point, I am already 4 hours into developing and still haven't got a clue how to make the tap looking like the sample markup. I did decide however, before I got too far with styling, to re-checked the rules and it's a good thing I did, because I have no idea how to make it responsive without using any JavaScript after I developed the UI. So I went back to doing more research about how to make awesome tabs with just html and css.

A few more hour pass and that's when I stumbled upon Pete's article on [Creating Content Tabs with Pure CSS](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2013/07/31/creating-content-tabs-with-pure-css/). This article literally shows you how to create tabs contents with just html and css. Without going into too much detail, the trick to making this work is using a hidden radio button and linking it to a label with a for attribute. Then, the label (ie, First Tab, Second Tab, etc) is used as a sort of button to trigger a checked that links back to the radio button. That now will allow you to target any style using the :checked selector. Absolutely no JavaScript was used to create the functional tabs. Amazing!

So after a while of sorting through Pete's approach, I finally got it - yay!. I then spent the next hour putting comment notes on the css markup so it would make sense to the next person reviewing.

So now that the whole tab ui markup docs make sense, it's now back to re-styling the element so it would closely resemble that of the website example - this is going to be another long hours - where's the coffee??? At this point, I literally lose track of how many hours I've been working... I think it's been 6 or 7 already.. but I know it's already 3 in the morning...

Finally, I have done it. I have finished one tab ui element (one of the horizontal ones)- yay! Now what!! Well, there's a couple more variation to go, so there you go, back to developing. This narrative writing is very helpful indeed (At this point, I think I have already been developing for 8 to 9 straight hours). This brief short narrative log is really helping me get through some mental block at times.

But wait, before I go on further, I think I will first push this element so it will be lived. Done.

Alright, I'm back and I just push that first ui tab element for team 12 members to review.

A little short while later - I just added the second tab ui element. Another variation of the horizontal tab.

A little more while later - I push the 3rd and final tab ui element. A vertical version of the tab. I briefly look over at the clock and it's already 9 am Sun... That's it. I'm done with the tab project. I went through this all night hakathon because that's the only way I could get things done. And I have less than an hour before I start my 9 hour shift of work and I know when I get back I'll be snoozing.

I hope this write up report make sense as I know I wouldn't have much time to do any reviews when I get up this morning Monday at 4 am PST... Shoot I only have 2 hours left before I submit this write up to make the 12 hours deadline. So here you go.
