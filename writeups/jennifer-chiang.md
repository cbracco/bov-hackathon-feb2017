> A summary of my experiences with Team 12 of the MD Hackathon on Feb 24-26 2017.

Our team met Friday evening to decide on design and tasks. Since Chris Bracco is a real life Front-end Web Developer, he graciously volunteered to be our project manager, create our team website and integrate all of the UI components to the site.

Overall, my experience with this hackathon is very positive. My takeaway from this is to ask more detail questions in regards to what my responsibilities are. This will help minimize some duplicating work. In addition, I will volunteer to work on more challenging sections for better learning experience. Lastly, big thanks to [@cbracco](http://github.com/cbracco) for making this experience nice and smooth.
