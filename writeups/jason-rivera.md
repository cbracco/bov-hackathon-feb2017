> A summary of my experiences with Team 12 of the MD Hackathon on Feb 24-26 2017.

I had a great experience working with team 12. [@cbracco](http://github.com/cbracco) did a wonderful job getting everything organized to help lead our team to success.

My role was to create the card components. Having six team
members helped us break everything into smaller tasks which I believe gave each team member enough time to focus on the quality of their component.

Overall I had a great experience getting to know my teammates and learning from their work.
