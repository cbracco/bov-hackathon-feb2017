# Chris Feltusâ€™s Writeup

> A summary of my experiences with Team 12 of the MD Hackathon on Feb 24-26 2017.

Our team is nearing completion, I just finished up the components assigned to me.

Normally I am accustom to animating elements with javascript, to me that is easier, but this time I made sure to use CSS only when possible and not use JS as a crutch.

I was assigned the accordion. The main idea for building this component only with CSS is to abuse the labels for input types of radio and manage state changes when one is selected. Other more common state changes for simpler UI components such as buttons might include the pseudo classes :hover, :focus, :active, :target

With that being said, I found the following resources beneficial for animating with CSS only.

I was assigned to this team at the last minute, and I am not sure if this team is in a different time zone than me, but I found it difficult to communicate with anyone after our initial rendezvous planing period on Friday evening. Everyone seemed self sufficient and was able to complete the objectives on their own, but I would have enjoyed more communication to bounce more ideas around. But other than that, everyone did good work.

One question that I have, is building and animating components discussed in-depth in the chapters? I dont think it was, or at least I dont remember it, and I am about to start working on my portfolio. I think some people that are struggling behind will get lost doing this without adequate help from more experienced team mates.
